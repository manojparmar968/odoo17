1. Python --> Python is a programing language with objects, modules, threads, exception &
    automatic memory management.
2. Key Feature in python --> 1.Python is an interpreted language.
    2.Python is dynamically typed.
    3.Python is well suited to oops.
3. dynamically typed --> means that type of the variable is determined only during runtime.
4. sotrong typed --> means that variable do have a type & that type matters when performing 
    operations on a variable.
5. diff b/w array and list --> array & list in python have the same way of storing data, but arrays
    can hold only a single data type element where as list can hold any data typed element.
6. Python class --> A class is like an object constructor or blue print for creating object.
7. __init__ --> is used to assign values to object properties.
8. self --> Self parameter is a refrence to the current instance of the class & is used to access
    variables that belongs to the class.
9. Memory Management in Python --> 1.Memory is managed by python private heap space.
    2.Allocation of python heap space for python object is done by python memory manager.
    3.Python also have an inbuilt garbage collector.
10. range() --> returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default & increment by 1 & ends 
    at a specified numbers.
11. diff b/w list & tuple --> 1.List is mutable & Tuple is immutable.
    2.a = list() & a = tuple(,)
    3.List iteration is slower, time consuming & Tuple iteration is faster, less time consuming.
    4.List consumes more memory & Tuple consumes less memory.
    5.List provides many inbuilt methods & Tuple have less inbuilt methods.
12. lambda function --> A lambda function is a small anonymous function. A lambda function can 
    take any number of arguments but can only have one expression.
13. iterators and types --> An iterator is an object that contains a countable numbers of values.
    two types 1. __iter__()
    2. __next__()
14. pickling --> Pickle module accepts any python object & converts it into a string representation
    & dumps it into a file by using dump function this process is called pickling.
15. unpickling
16. generators
17. dictionary
18. args
19. kwargs
20. shallow copy, example
21. deep copy, example
22. decorators
23. sets
24. oops concepts
25. list compreshension
