1. Find duplicate rows in a table
Select field_name,COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY field_name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 ORDER BY field_name;

2. Find Second Max from table
select max(salary) as SecondHighSalary from employee where salary < (select max(salary) from employee);

3. update table 
UPDATE table_name set field_name = 'value';

4. How to get password or update a password of user's
SELECT id,login,password from res_users where active = True;
update res_users set password = 'admin' where id = ;

5. Get employee_name, department_no, department_name based on department_name = 'EEE'
select t2.employee_name,t1.department_no,t1.department_name from t1 
JOIN t2 ON t1.department_no = t2.department_no where t1.department_name = 'EEE';

6. Count emp in each department.
select t1.department_name, COUNT(*) from t1  
JOIN t2 ON t1.department_no = t2.department_no GROUP BY t1.department_name;

7. department_no,department_name,employee_name
select t1.department_no,t1.department_name,t2.employee_name from t1 
left outer join t2 ON t1.department_no = t2.department_no;

8. find department where salary >= 24000
select t1.department_name,count(*) from t1
join t2 on t1.department_no = t2.department_no group by t1.department_name 
having t2.salary>=24000;

5. Join --> is used to combine columns from one (self join) or more tables.
    a. Inner Join --> selects those records that have match values in both tables.
        select field_name1,field_name2 FROM table_name1 INNER JOIN table_name2 ON field_name1 = field_name2;
    
    b. left join --> returns all records from the left table & matching records from right table.
        select field_name1,field_name2 from table_name1 LEFT JOIN table_name2 ON field_name1 = field_name2;

        left outer join --> only rows from the left table.
        select field_name1,field_name2 from table_name1 LEFT JOIN table_name2 ON field_name1 = field_name2
        WHERE id IS NULL;
    
    c. right join --> returns all records from the right table & matching records from left table.
        select field_name1,field_name2 from table_name1 RIGHT JOIN table_name2 ON field_name1 = field_name2;

        right outer join --> only rows from the right table.
        select field_name1,field_name2 from table_name1 RIGHT JOIN table_name2 ON field_name1 = field_name2
        WHERE id IS NULL;
    
    d. full outer join/full join --> returns all records when there is a match in both left or right 
        table records.
        select field_name1,field_name2 from table_name1 FULL OUTER JOIN table_name2 ON field_name1 = field_name2;

    e. cross join --> allow you to produce a cartesian product of rows in two or more tables.
        select * from table_name1 CROSS JOIN table_name2;
    
    f. Natural Join --> creates an implicit join based on the same column names in the joined tables.
        SELECT * FROM table1 NATURAL [INNER, LEFT, RIGHT] JOIN table2;

2. index --> Indexes are a common way to enhance database performance. An index allows the database 
server to find and retrieve specific rows much faster.
    CREATE INDEX idx_field_name ON table_name(field_name in table e.g phone);

3. EXPLAIN --> statement to explain a query.
    EXPLAIN SELECT *

4. Primary Key --> Constrains uniquely identifies each record in a table. Primary key must contains
unique values & can not contains NULL values.

5. unique Key --> The unique Constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.
Both Primary key & unique key Constraints provide uniqueness for a column or set of columns.

6. Foreign Key --> is a field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.

7. ACID Properties
    Atomic -->
